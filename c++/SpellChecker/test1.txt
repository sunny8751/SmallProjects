A new field campaign on the remote Ellef Ringnes Island, Canadian High Arctic, found an outstanding number of seep mounds from the Cretaceous climate warming in the past. These seep mounds are carbonate deposits that formed when past methane gas leaked into the seafloor. Scientists have found that these seep mounds formed over a very short time interval immediately after the Cretaceous global warming, and this suggests that the warming climate destabilized gas hydrates and released large amounts of methane. This is a significant discovery as modern climate change could result in a similar release of methane gas, which has twenty times the impact of carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. 	The methane cold seeps were first discovered in the 1970s during the first geologic mappings of Ellef Ringnes Island, one of the most remote and difficult to access islands in the Canadian High Arctic, accessible only by helicopter. During that expedition, scientists found a strange spaghetti-like rock, which no one was able to identify or understand. So, during another field campaign during 2009-2011, geologists were able to perform chemical analysis on these spaghetti-like features and found that they were formed by fossil tube worms that lived near the carbonate rock formed by the oxidation of methane. As the methane leaked into the seafloor, microbes oxidized the methane as a source of energy to produce carbonate deposits. These microbes thus allowed the carbonate deposits to host unique fauna, one of which was the tube worm. Now, millions of years after the Cretaceous age, the tube worms and other forms of life near the methane seeps had fossilized. Because these carbonate mounds were formed in deep water, they had also been preserved and not eroded away. During the expedition, the team of scientists discovered over 130 methane seep mounds in the rock record over four weeks of exploring the site, making it one of the most extensive sites of these features in the world. This discovery is significant as it was found that all of the seep mounds formed during a very narrow range of geologic time. Since the seep mounds were formed from methane leaking into seawater around the period of global warming, scientists concluded that the warming climate caused methane frozen as methane hydrates in the sea floor to be released suddenly, leading to a significant increase in the greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere at that time.	Reading about this study made me realize how much we still do not know about the current global climate change. By emitting unprecedented amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, we have instigated a global climate change of which the effects are still actively being studied and discovered. For example, this study demonstrated how past global warming during the Cretaceous period led to large amounts of methane gas being released from the frozen methane hydrates in the sea floor, indicating the potential for similar destabilization of gas hydrates as a result of modern global warming. In this way, we are still actively learning about what may come in the future by studying what happened in past instances of global warming.	This study also strongly related to what we learned in class. For example, as warming oceans release trapped methane, this can cause further warming, releasing more methane. This is just another example of a positive feedback loop, similar to the ice-albedo feedback loop that we learned in class. As such, this release of methane gas has been suggested by some as the mechanism that could drive runaway greenhouse gas events. In our class lab, we investigated conditions that would cause runaway greenhouse gas by increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. However, this events could alternatively happen with methane gas as it is twenty times more effective as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. In addition, we studied in-depth the effects of greenhouse gases on the Earth and how it captured heat radiated from the Earth and radiated some of it back onto the surface of Earth. Because the greenhouse gases prevented as much heat from leaving the planet, the Earth was forced to heat up in order to radiate as much heat as it was receiving from the Sun. This followed the concept that we studied in class where the input of energy from the sun had to be equal to the output of energy radiated from the planet. We also studied different greenhouse gases present in Earth’s atmosphere such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane gas. I found it interesting that methane gas was twenty times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, especially because the majority of our attention has been on the production of carbon dioxide. Based off the findings of the study, it seemed that the events caused by global warming, such as the mass release of methane gas, posed a more significant problem than human actions.I also related the article’s findings to our study of methanogens, which produce methane gas for energy. In this case, the article described microorganisms that instead oxidized the methane gas to produce energy. I found it interesting that there not only existed organisms that could produce methane gas as a by-product but also organisms that could use this methane gas to produce energy, thus creating a habitat for other more complex organisms to survive.	I really enjoyed reading about this study because of the sheer amount of physical work that went into discovering the methane seeps mounds. For example, the first sample of the spaghetti-like rock feature that was discovered in the 1970s was lost, limiting any further analysis on this sample. So, an expedition was launched in 2010 to revisit the site. As the site was located in a very remote and difficult to access location, the scientists had to reach the site by helicopter. After finding the first seep mound in the arctic tundra, they saw another mound in the distance, suggesting the presence of a second mound. From this second mound, they saw more and more, leading to more than four weeks of trudging through the thick mud to discover a total of over 130 seep mounds over an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers. Though much hard work was involved, the implications of the work were also staggering. The sheer amount of mounds discovered meant that a very significant amount of methane gas had been released into the atmosphere, suggesting that such a catastrophic event could possibly happen again. Learning about this study made me realize for the first time how serious the global climate change situation was because the warming oceans could set off unforeseen events such as a sudden methane “burp.” In fact, we are seeing methane gas being released from the sea near the Arctic today, a process that will continue to get worse due to the positive feedback loop that occurs from the released methane gas increasing global warming and the heating of our oceans. If the team further researches this topic, I would love to see more analysis on the effects of the large release of methane gas on the Cretaceous climate warming. The article mentions how the seep mounds indicated that methane gas was released and the possibility that it had a substantial effect on the climate change, yet it does not give any quantitative analysis on that effect. I would love to learn about how much the release of methane gas increased the greenhouse effect that caused the climate change. In addition, I would enjoy seeing any research on current developments of methane seep mounds as methane gas is actively being released from the ocean. The presence of the seep mounds in the past seems to suggest that it may happen again in the near future, but I would love to see specific research to pinpoint the development of seep mounds and whether they present as a significant problem to global warming as those in the Cretaceous period.BibliographyKrista Williscroft, Stephen E.
