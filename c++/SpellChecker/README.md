Checks the spelling of text. The program can accept either a text file or text you input into the console (standard input).

The folder contains two text files that you can already use (test1.txt and test2.txt).

To compile:
g++ main.cpp -o main

To run:
./main test1.txt test2.txt

This will test both test files and then allow you to type in your own custom text. To quit, type "q" and press enter.
