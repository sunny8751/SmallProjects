The Martian Technology Analysis and Implications
	Scientists have grappled with the concept of sustaining life on other planets, and in EAS1601 we, as students, have studied the conditions and necessary building blocks for life to form on planets other than Earth. The Martian similarly explores this topic, as astronaut Mark Watney is forced to survive on Mars for an extended period of time by producing his own food and water, maintaining a sustainable source of oxygen, and using the leftover technology to find a way to contact those back on Earth.
	Watney prepares to survive on Mars for an extended period by using a “systems science” style of thinking. He first implements a water system by synthesizing water using hydrazine, feeding the potato plants using the water, and excreting the water as urine after eating the potatoes and drinking the water. He then creates a nutrient system by taking in nutrients from eating the potatoes and then giving the nutrients back to the soil using his waste. He also implements an energy system. He gathers energy from the sun using solar panels and uses this energy to power the available technologies and charge the batteries for his rover. In addition, Watney uses “systems science” style of thinking to create an oxygen system by creating the oxygenator. This machine uses the carbon dioxide in the air to create oxygen, which Watney breathes and then exhales carbon dioxide. Finally, Watney finds a way to communicate with NASA by utilizing the old Mars Pathfinder. He uses the “systems science” style of thinking by setting the antenna, camera, and signs to interact with each other to communicate with the replica Pathfinder of the NASA station on Earth. He realizes that NASA station can see what where he directs the camera, and he uses this as communication.
	The first science innovation that Watney makes is his Hab, the shelter that protects him from harmful radiation and freezing temperatures at night and that keeps the oxygen and water from escaping. Watney is then forced to generate oxygen for himself by creating the “oxygenator,” a device that uses the Mars Ascent Vehicle’s fuel generator to convert carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. In addition, Watney keeps himself warm in his rover by building a makeshift heater. He uses the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) to isolate the heat energy from its natural radioactive decay. When Watney realizes that the Mars Ascent Vehicle he was using to get off of Mars was too heavy, he then came up with the innovative idea to take off the nose airlock of the spacecraft and replace it with tarp. This made the spacecraft lighter and allowed it to leave Mars’ orbit. Finally, Watney is able to accomplish much of what he does through his incredible space suit. This is a science innovation that NASA has come up with in the movie, creating a flexible suit to protect against temperature, radiation, and lack of oxygen.
	The Martian makes heavy use of different technologies and scientific concepts, many of which are correct. For example, in Project Elrond, the crew needs to return back to Mars to get Watney but does not have enough fuel for the extended trip. They thus decide to use Earth’s gravity to slingshot back to Mars, thus saving enough fuel for the entire trip. This is a very valid scientific concept as many unmanned space probes have done this in the past to gain greater speed. In addition, a key part of Watney’s survival is his ability to grow his own food on Mars. This has been proven to be a likely probability of happening in the future as NASA has experimented with growing food in space and has also successfully grown lettuce in zero gravity space. Watney is able to accomplish this remarkable feat by synthesizing abundant water, utilize Mars’ sunlight, and use human waste as fertilizer to provide the necessary nutrients. The only limitation is that Watney solely produces potatoes, which would not provide adequate nutrients for an extended period of time and would quickly deplete the soil’s minerals and thus fail to grow after a period of time. Also, Watney derives his main source of energy and power from solar energy. Using huge solar panels, he can charge batteries for his Mars rover and continue to use most of the technology that he came with. This accessible energy source is currently the future for NASA’s ventures into other planets. Finally, Watney communicates with NASA using the old Mars Pathfinder’s camera through hexadecimal numbers. This ingenious method of communication would work as long as the lander could receive a signal from Earth.
Despite the incredible scientific accuracy of the movie, there are some things that it got wrong. Specifically, the movie starts out with a wind storm that causes Watney to separate with the rest of his crew, thus setting the stage for his abandonment and forcing him to find a way to live on Mars. However, despite the high winds that Mars experiences, the lack of a substantial atmosphere on Mars compared to Earth would not have created enough pressure to smash the satellite dish into Watney in the first place. Also a huge part of Watney’s survival rested on his ability to produce water by decomposing the available hydrazine and burning it to create H2O molecules. However, this exothermic reaction would have released massive amounts of heat, making it infeasible and incinerating Watney when the experiment first failed and blew up. In addition, Watney leaves Mars by making the Mars Ascent Vehicle lighter. He does this by taking off the nose of the ship and replacing it with a tarp. However, this would have increased the structural stability of the entire ship, making it very difficult to launch successfully out of Mars’ gravity. It may be plausible, but the chances of success are miniscule, something that the movie failed to properly convey. Another inaccuracy was Watney’s ability to navigate in space like Iron Man using a hole in his palm. The direct contact that his skin had with the vacuum of space would have given him frostbite, and it is unlikely that he could have successfully maneuvered using this technique. Finally, Mars has high amounts of toxic radiation, and the Hab and spacesuit would not have allowed Watney to safely live on the surface for such a long period of time without experiencing cancer or other radiation effects. 
All in all, The Martian depicts NASA’s goal of living on Mars with surprising scientific accuracy. Although it does contain some unrealistic scenes, it does a great job of showing the audience what living on a different planet may be like. This makes it very relevant to EAS1601, which focuses on searching for a habitable planet to support living organisms and eventually humans. As we have been learning about the basic necessities for life such as the required elements on the periodic table, the movie paints a clear picture on how we could create sources of water, food, and oxygen. It reinforces the idea that solar energy is crucial to extraterrestrial survival, toxic radiation from the sun is a huge concern, and space travel takes a very long time. It has encouraged people to accept the idea of habiting other planets and has opened avenues of thoughtful discussion. If we could potentially survive on Mars, then the discovery of another planet similar to Earth could be a very good candidate for a habitable planet. Scientists are thus actively searching for possible planets using methods that we have studied in class such as transit photometry and radial velocity. Therefore, the movie has paved the way for scientific advances and possibilities that may allow humans to one day survive on planets outside Earth.
